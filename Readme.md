# yaml.info

This website aims to be a useful resource for YAML users and developers.

It's pretty new, and there are still a lot of missing chapters, but I'm already
glad for suggestions on how to improve, and what kind of information you would
like to see.

## Tutorial

There are many pages out there explaining YAML. Most of them are missing
stuff or use the wrong terminology. Also most of them were written for
YAML 1.1, and there are some significant differences in YAML 1.2.

I think it's important to use the official vocabulary that is also used
in the YAML Specification.

## Libraries

The library section can be useful for users.

It also has information for developers implementing YAML libraries,
or implementing apps using YAML.


## About

I have been working a lot with different aspects of YAML for the last years
and saw the need for a website with this kind of information.
