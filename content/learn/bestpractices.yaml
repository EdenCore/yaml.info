      Here are some tips and tricks for how to write and format YAML files.

- section:
    name: format
    title: Formatting
    content:
    - <h3>Indentation</h3>
    - Tabs are forbidden as indentation.
    - You can freely choose the number of spaces for indentation.
      More than 8 probably don't make sense, and also this might be a hard limit
      in the next YAML version.
    - You can use different indentation inside of the same YAML document,
      as long as it is the same for one level.
    - The recommended number of spaces is `2`.
    - yaml: |
        # Two spaces
        top level:
          a: b
          c: d
    - yaml: |
        # Different number of spaces are invalid
        top level:
          a: b
         c: d
    - yaml: |
        # No tabs, please!
        top level:
        	a: b
        	c: d
    - The opinions on sequence indentation differ.
    - |
      The YAML creators recommend to use "zero-indented" sequences:
    - yaml: |
        a sequence:
        - with
        - three
        - items

    - <h3>Layout</h3>
    - |
      Nested sequences can be formatted in a compact way:
    - yaml: |
        sequence:
        - level one
        - - level two
    - |
      When you have a sequence with more than one level, flow style might be
      more readable:
    - yaml: |
        ---
        dice rolls:
        - - 2
          - 5
        - - 3
          - 4
        ---
        dice rolls:
        - [2, 5]
        - [3, 4]

    - |
      You cannot start a sequence or another mapping on the same line as
      a mapping key:
    - yaml: |
        key: inner: map
    - yaml: |
        key: - sequence
    - |
      But you can start a mapping as a sequence item on the same line:
    - yaml: |
        ---
        sequence:
        -
          a: b
          c: d
        ---
        # compact
        sequence:
        - a: b
          c: d

- section:
    name: file
    title: File Extension
    content:
    - The recommended file extension is `.yaml`.
    - You will find a lot of applications that chose `.yml` though. Some
      also allow both extensions.

      You do not need to [quote](#topic:quote) scalars in most cases. The
      [Quoting Chapter](quote.html) has detailed information about that.
    - |
      If you are unsure, here are some hints. To be safe, use quotes:
    - |
      <ul>
      <li>If it could be a special type, but you want a string (TODO: link to schema chapter)
      <li>If the scalar starts with a non-alphanumeric character
      <li>If the scalar contains control characters
      <li>If the scalar contains tabs
      <li>If the scalar contains `:<space>`, `<space>#`, `-<space>`, `:<end-of-string>`
      <li>If you are in flow style and the scalar contains one of`{}[],`
      </ul>
