    YAML is best known for its indentation based block style. Each entry, a
    sequence item, a key value pair or a scalar, is on its own line.
  - |
    There are many use cases where a more compact style is helpful.
    in YAML it's called [Flow Style](#topic:flowstyle).
  - |
    There are Flow Style Collections and Flow Scalars.
  - |
    This chapter is about Collections, while Flow Scalars are part of the
    [Quoting Chapter](quote.html).

    Let's say you define a list of perl versions in a CI configuration file:
  - yaml: |
      ---
      perl:
      - 5.8
      - 5.10
      - 5.12
      - 5.14
      - 5.16
      - 5.18
      - 5.20
      - 5.22
      - 5.24
      - 5.26
      - 5.28
      - 5.30
  - |
    You can write that in flow style to save space.
    A sequence is enclosed in square brackets `[]`, and entries are separated
    by commas `,`:
  - yaml: |
      ---
      perl: [5.8, 5.10, 5.12, 5.14, 5.16, 5.18, 5.20, 5.22, 5.24, 5.26, 5.28, 5.30]
  - |
    That looks similar to JSON, and in fact, JSON is a subset of YAML 1.2.
    The difference is that you don't need to quote the strings, just like in
    block style.
  - |
    If the line gets too long, you can wrap it:
  - yaml: |
      ---
      perl: [5.8, 5.10, 5.12, 5.14, 5.16, 5.18, 5.20, 5.22,
        5.24, 5.26, 5.28, 5.30]
  - |
    You can also put the brackets on their own lines:
  - yaml: |
      ---
      perl: [
          5.8, 5.10, 5.12, 5.14, 5.16, 5.18, 5.20, 5.22,
          5.24, 5.26, 5.28, 5.30
        ]
  - |
    Note that even the last closing bracket must be indented (more than the
    parent block style item), so the following
    would be invalid:
  - yaml: |
      ---
      perl: [
        5.8, 5.10, 5.12, 5.14, 5.16, 5.18, 5.20, 5.22,
        5.24, 5.26, 5.28, 5.30
      ]
  - |
    You might notice that many YAML parsers accept it, though. To be compatible
    with all parsers, you should indent it.
  - |
    You can also use comments inside flow style collections:
  - yaml: |
      ---
      perl: [ # Test all important perl versions
        5.8, 5.10, 5.12, 5.14, 5.16, 5.18, 5.20, 5.22,
        5.24, 5.26, 5.28, 5.30
      ]


- name: mapping
  title: Mappings
  content:
  - |
    Let's say you have a list of coordinates. Each coordinate set is a mapping:
  - yaml: |
      ---
      - x: 3
        y: 4
        z: 5
      - x: 5
        y: 4
        z: 3
  - |
    In Flow Style, a mapping is enclosed in curly braces `{}`, and commas `,`
    separate the key value pairs from each other:
  - yaml: |
      ---
      - {x: 3, y: 4, z: 5}
      - {x: 5, y: 4, z: 3}
  - |
    Or even more compact:
  - yaml: |
      ---
      [ {x: 3, y: 4, z: 5}, {x: 5, y: 4, z: 3} ]

- name: quoting
  title: Quoting
  content:
  - |
    The rules for quoting are a bit more strict than in block style.
  - yaml: |
      --- # Block
      no: prob{lem,
      also: f]ine

      --- # Flow
      {
        please: 'quo{te,',
        me: 't]oo'
      }
  - |
    See the [Quoting Chapter](quote.html) for details about which character
    sequences require quoting additional to block style rules.

    Inside of flow style collections you can only use flow collections and
    flow scalars.
