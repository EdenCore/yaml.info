    A YAML file or Stream can contain multiple [Documents](#topic:document).
  - |
    YAML Libraries typically have functions like `load` and `load_all` to read
    only the first or all documents.

- name: start
  title: Document Start
  content:
  - |
    For the first document, the Document start marker is optional, but it is
    also a way to mark something as YAML explicitly:
  - yaml: |
      ---
      # with optional document start marker
      invoice number: 314159
      name: Santa Claus
      address: North Pole

  - |
    If a file contains multiple documents, they must be separated with the
    document start marker:
  - yaml: |
      invoice number: 314159
      name: Santa Claus
      address: North Pole
      ---
      invoice number: 314160
      name: Santa Claus
      address: North Pole
      ---
      invoice number: 314161
      name: Santa Claus
      address: North Pole
  - |
    The Document Start is usually on its own line. Mappings or Sequences must
    start on the next line.
  - |
    If a document's top level node is a scalar, then it can also start on the same
    line:
  - yaml: |
       --- | # Top Level Block Scalar
         line 1
         line 2
         line 3
       --- top
         level
         plain scalar
  - |
    In case of top level scalars, it is recommended to always use the document
    start marker, and always indent the content. Some libraries don't accept
    a top level scalar which is not indented.

- name: end
  title: Document End
  content:
  - |
    There is also the Document End Marker `...`.
  - |
    It is also optional, but useful or recommended in some cases.
  - |
    <h3>Open Ended Block Scalars</h3>
  - |
    Sometimes [Block Scalars](#topic:blockscalar) can have trailing newlines:
  - yaml: |
      block: |+
        line 1
        line 2
        line 3


      more: content
  - |
    In the previous example, the value for `block` will have three trailing
    linebreaks.
  - |
    In the following example, it also has three linebreaks:

  - yaml: |+
      block: |+
        line 1
        line 2
        line 3


  - |
    The problem here is, if this is the last item in the file, it might easily happen
    that someone editing the file accidentally adds another line at the end or
    saves the file without the last line ending.
  - |
    In these cases, it's recommended to explicitly end the document:
  - yaml: |+
      block: |+
        line 1
        line 2
        line 3


      ...
  - <h3>Streaming Context</h3>
  - |
    When YAML is used in a Stream, for example over network, it might be
    important to tell the receiver that the document has ended.

  - yaml: |
      ---
      invoice number: 314159
      name: Santa Claus
      address: North Pole
      ...
      ---
      invoice number: 314160
      name: Santa Claus
      address: North Pole
      ...
      ---
      invoice number: 314161
      name: Santa Claus
      address: North Pole

  - |
    <b>Theoretically</b> it's also possible to only use the Document End Marker
    to separate Documents:
  - yaml: |
      invoice number: 314159
      name: Santa Claus
      address: North Pole
      ...
      invoice number: 314160
      name: Santa Claus
      address: North Pole
      ...
      invoice number: 314161
      name: Santa Claus
      address: North Pole

  - |
    However, that's not supported by all libraries. To be safe, always use the
    Document start marker when using multiple documents.

- name: directive
  title: Directives
  content:
  - |
    YAML has two [Directives](#topic:directive):
    <ul>
    <li>YAML Version Directive</li>
    <li>YAML Tag Directive</li>
    </ul>
  - <h3>YAML Version Directive</h3>
  - |
    The Version directive is used to tell the YAML processor which version
    of YAML the document is written in.
  - yaml: |
      %YAML 1.2
      ---
      a: mapping

  - |
    If you use a directive, the Document Start Marker must always follow.
    In the YAML Specification, the Document Start is actually called "Directives
    End Marker".
  - |
    In YAML 1.2, a directive is <b>only</b> applied to the following document,
    not to the whole file or stream.
  - |
    So if you have multiple documents, you need both the Document Start and End
    Markers:
  - yaml: |
      %YAML 1.2
      ---
      invoice number: 314159
      name: Santa Claus
      address: North Pole
      ...
      %YAML 1.2
      ---
      invoice number: 314160
      name: Santa Claus
      address: North Pole
      ...
      %YAML 1.2
      ---
      invoice number: 314161
      name: Santa Claus
      address: North Pole

  - <h3>YAML Tag Directive</h3>
  - |
    Tag Directives are rarely used.
  - |
    They provide a way to create shorthand tags for custom processing.
  - |
    An example is the [Unity3d](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/YAMLSceneExample.html)
    application (which is using YAML 1.1).
  - yaml: |
      %YAML 1.1
      %TAG !u! tag:unity3d.com,2011:
      --- !u!header
      SerializedFile:
      # ...
  - |
    It maps tags like `!u!header` to `tag:unity3d.com,2011:header`.
  - |
    There is only <b>one</b> tag directive which always used by default, so you
    don't have to specify this in a YAML file:
  - yaml: |
      %TAG !! tag:yaml.org,2002:
      ---
      # ...
  - |
    This allows to use the standard YAML tags like `!!int` or `!!bool` in their
    short form.
  - |
    But the standard YAML tags are rarely needed. Read more about Tags and
    Schema in the [Schema Chapter](schema.html).
